# Naive UI

Naive UI is a Vue 3 component library.

To know how to install it, see [Installation](installation).

It is fairly complete, themeable, written in typescript, not too slow.

## Fairly Complete

There are more than 80 components. Hope they can help you write less code.

What's more, they are all treeshakable.

## Theme Customizable

We provide an advanced type safe theme system that is built with typescript. All you need is to provide a theme overrides object in JS. Then all the stuffs will be done by us.

What's more, no less/sass/css variables, no webpack loaders are required. And you can try the theme editor on the bottom right of the page.

## Uses TypeScript

All the stuff in Naive UI is written in TypeScript. It can work with your typescript project seamlessly.

What's more, you don't need to import any CSS to use the components.

## Fast

I try to make it not rather slow. At least select, tree, transfer, table and cascader work with virtual list.

What's more, ..., no more. Just enjoy it.
