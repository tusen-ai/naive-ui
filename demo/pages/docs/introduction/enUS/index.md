# Naive UI

Naive UI is a Vue 3 component library.

To know how to install it, see [Installation](installation).

It is fairly complele, themeable, wrote in typescript, not too slow.

## Fairly Complete

There are more than 70 components. Hope they can help you write less code.

What's more, they are all treeshakable.

## Customizable Themes

We provide an advanced type safe theme system that built with typescript. All you need is to provide a theme overrides object in JS. Then all the staff is done by us.

What's more, no less/sass/css variables, no webpack loaders are required. And you can try the theme editor on the bottom right of the page.

## Uses TypeScript

All the staff in Naive UI is wrote in TypeScript. It can work with your typescript project seamlessly.

What's more, you don't need to import any CSS to use the components.

## Not too Slow

I try to make it not rather slow. At least select, tree, transfer, table and cascader work with virtual list.

What's more, ..., no more. Just enjoy it.
