      "When it comes to virtual lists, it can make you feel like the list is infinite, but in reality it is just secretly hiding the invisible elements, like a lazy programmer with a blank note saying, You can't see me, and I won't load myself!",
      'Sometimes the question itself is the answer, the process of pursuit is an answer, language has the ability to destroy, once a thing is said, it is destroyed, I say to silence, but I say silence is gone, I say to enjoy the moment, as soon as I enjoy the moment, the moment slips away',
      'Freud read dreams and discovered a secret passage to the unconscious mind. Hemingway read the sea and found that life is a fish that takes a lifetime to catch. Van Gogh read the wheat fields and found that art hid behind the sun to cool itself. Rodin read the human body and discovered beautiful coastlines that Columbus had not. Camus reads Kafka and finds that half of the truth has been told'
