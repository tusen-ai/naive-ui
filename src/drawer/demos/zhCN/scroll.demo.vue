      William Stoner is born on a small farm in 1891. One day his father
      suggests he should attend the University of Missouri to study agriculture.
      Stoner agrees but, while studying a compulsory literature course, he
      quickly falls in love with literary studies. Without telling his parents,
      Stoner quits the agriculture program and studies only the humanities. He
      completes his MA in English and begins teaching. In graduate school, he is
      friendly with fellow students Gordon Finch and Dave Masters. World War I
      begins, and Gordon and Dave enlist. Despite pressure from Gordon, Stoner
      decides to remain in school during the war. Masters is killed in France,
      while Finch sees action and becomes an officer. At a faculty party, Stoner
      meets and becomes infatuated with a young woman named Edith, who is
      staying with an aunt for a few weeks. Stoner woos Edith, and she agrees to
      marry him. Stoner’s marriage to Edith is bad from the start. It gradually
      becomes clear that Edith has profound emotional problems. Significantly,
      she is bitter about having cancelled a trip to Europe with her aunt to
      marry Stoner. After three years of marriage, Edith suddenly informs Stoner
      that she wants a baby. She suddenly becomes passionate sexually, but this
      period is brief. When their daughter Grace is born, Edith remains
      bedridden for nearly a year, and Stoner largely cares for their child
      alone. He grows close with his young daughter, who spends most of her time
      with him in his study. Stoner gradually realizes that Edith is waging a
      campaign to separate him from his daughter emotionally. For the most part,
      Stoner accepts Edith's mistreatment. He begins to teach with more
      enthusiasm, but still, year in and year out, his marriage with Edith
      remains perpetually unsatisfactory and fraught. Grace becomes an unhappy,
      secretive child who smiles and laughs often but is emotionally hollow. At
      the University, Finch becomes the acting dean of the faculty. Stoner feels
      compelled by his conscience to fail a student named Charles Walker. He is
      a close protégé of a colleague, Professor Hollis Lomax, and like him is
      physically disabled. The student is clearly dishonest and cannot fulfil
      the requirements of Stoner's course but, despite this, the decision to
      expel or retain Walker is put on hold. After his promotion to head of the
      department, Lomax takes every opportunity to exact revenge upon Stoner
      throughout the rest of his career. A collaboration between Stoner and a
      younger instructor in the department, Katherine Driscoll, develops into a
      romantic love affair. Ironically, after the affair begins, Stoner’s
      relationships with Edith and Grace also improve. At some point, Edith
      finds out about the affair, but does not seem to mind it. When Lomax
      learns about it, however, he begins to put pressure on Katherine, who also
      teaches in the English department. Stoner and Driscoll agree it best to
      end the affair so as not to derail the academic work they both feel called
      to follow. Katherine quietly slips out of town, never to be seen by him
      again. Eventually, Stoner, older now and hard of hearing, is beginning to
      become a legendary figure in the English department despite Lomax's
      opposition. He begins to spend more time at home, ignoring Edith's signs
      of displeasure at his presence. Entering adulthood, Grace enrolls at the
      University of Missouri. The following year, Grace announces she is
      pregnant and marries the father of her child. Grace’s husband enlists in
      the army and dies before the baby is born. Grace goes to St. Louis with
      the baby to live with her husband's parents. She visits Stoner and Edith
      occasionally, and Stoner realizes that Grace has developed a drinking
      problem. As Stoner’s life is coming to an end, his daughter Grace comes to
      visit him. Deeply unhappy and addicted to alcohol, Grace halfheartedly
      tries to reconcile with Stoner, and he sees that his daughter, like her
      mother, will never be happy. When Grace leaves, Stoner feels as though the
      young child that he loved died long ago. Stoner thinks back over his life.
      He thinks about where he failed, and wonders if he could have been more
      loving to Edith, if he could have been stronger, or if he could have
      helped her more. Later, he believes that he is wrong to think of himself
      as a failure. During an afternoon when he is alone, he sees various young
      students passing by on their way to class outside his window, and he dies,
      dropping his copy of the one book that he published years earlier as a
      young professor.
