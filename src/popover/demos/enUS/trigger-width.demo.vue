# Use trigger width

Set `width="trigger"` to make popover's width the same as its trigger.
</markdown>

<template>
  <n-popover width="trigger">
    <template #trigger>
      <n-button>I would like to leave this city</n-button>
    </template>
    This old town don't smell too pretty and I can feel the warning signs
    running around my mind
  </n-popover>
</template>
