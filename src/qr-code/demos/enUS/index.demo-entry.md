### About QR code error correction level

The error correction level of the two-dimensional code refers to the error correction capability used in the generation of the two-dimensional code, which determines the ability of the two-dimensional code to be correctly decoded when it is damaged or partially invisible.

Two-dimensional code standards (such as QR codes) define four error correction levels: L, M, Q, and H. Each level provides different error correction capabilities and tolerance.

- `L (Low)`: Provides approximately `7%` recovery capability.

- `M (Middle)`: Provides approximately `15%` recovery capacity.

- `Q (High)`: Provides approximately `25%` recovery capacity.

- `H (Max)`: Provides approximately `30%` recovery capacity.

Selecting a higher error correction level can improve the fault tolerance of the two-dimensional code, that is, it can still be correctly decoded under a certain degree of damage or deformation, but at the same time, it will increase the density of the two-dimensional code, making the two-dimensional code occupy a larger space.
