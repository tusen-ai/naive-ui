      And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of
      Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of
      Daisy’s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must
      have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not
      know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity
      beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the
      night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year
      by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no
      matter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . .
      And one fine morning—— So we beat on, boats against the current, borne
      back ceaselessly into the past.
