    And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby’s
    wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s dock.
    He had come a long way to this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so
    close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was
    already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city,
    where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.<br><br>

    Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year
    recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter—tomorrow we will
    run faster, stretch out our arms farther. . . . And one fine morning——<br><br>

    So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the
    past.
